# Gradient Descent and Logistic Model


## Getting Started

### Installing Python
To use the script, you will need to install Python 3.6.x and add to path:
- [Python 3.6.x](https://www.python.org/downloads/release/python-360/)

Install the dependent libraries by typing the following in cmd/terminal:
```
$ pip install -r requirements.txt
```

### Starting the Script
To run the script, go to the root directory and run `python` in cmd/terminal and type the following in the python console:
```
>>> from knn_main import *
```
*Note: ensure that python refers to Python 3.6.x*

### Running Manual GD & SGD on Logistic Regression Model (Q1)
Type the following in the python console:
```
>>> run_Q1()
```

### Training Neural Network Model on MNIST_small (Q2)
Type the following in the python console:
```
>>> run_Q2()
```

## Built With
